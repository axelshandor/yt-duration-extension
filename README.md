A lightweight and powerful Google Chrome extension that calculates the total duration of any YouTube playlist. No more manual math—know exactly how much time you need for your watch later, tutorials, or music queues.

## 🚀 Features

- **Instant Calculation:** Displays total hours, minutes, and seconds directly on the playlist page.
- **Smart "Scroll & Update" Button:** YouTube only loads a few videos at a time (lazy loading). Our unique feature automatically scrolls through long playlists to capture every single video and update the total time accurately.
- **Native Integration:** Designed to look and feel like a part of the YouTube interface.
- **Privacy Focused:** No data collection, no tracking. Calculations happen entirely in your browser.
